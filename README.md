## What is Letta Code?

Letta Code is a command-line harness around the stateful Letta [Agents API](https://docs.letta.com/api-reference/overview). You can use Letta Code to create and connect with any Letta agent (even non-coding agents!) - Letta Code simply gives your agents the ability to interact with your local dev environment, directly in your terminal.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Letta Code is a **research preview** in active development, and may have bugs or unexpected issues. To learn more about the roadmap and chat with the dev team, visit our Discord at [discord.gg/letta](https:/discord.gg/letta). Contributions welcome, join the fun.

## Quickstart

> Get a Letta API key at: [https://app.letta.com](https://app.letta.com/)

Install the package via [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm):
```bash
npm install -g @letta-ai/letta-code
```

Make sure you have your Letta API key set in your environment:
```bash
export LETTA_API_KEY=...
```

Then run `letta` to start Letta Code (see various command-line options below):
```
letta
```

Any of the agents you create in Letta Code will be viewable (and fully interactable!) inside the [Agent Development Environment](https://app.letta.com).

## Persistence

All agents in Letta are *stateful*: they live and maintain context forever, and can self-edit their own [memory blocks](https://www.letta.com/blog/memory-blocks) via memory tools.
Different agents in Letta can share the same memory blocks: for example, you can have multiple agents working on different coding projects that all share a memory about the user's general coding style preferences, while also having independent memory blocks storing memory specific to their own project.

In Letta Code, we provide a default memory configuration that has both globally and locally shared blocks:
```text
\ ~/.letta/settings.json (shared across all agents spawned on your device)
--> persona block (determines the behavior of your coding agent)
--> human block (tracks important information about user coding preferences)

\ [your-current-dir]/.letta/settings.json (shared across agents spawned specifically in this directory)
--> project block (tracks important information about this specific coding project)
```

There are three main ways to start Letta:
1. Run `letta`: creates a new agent, looks in `settings.json` files for shared memory blocks IDs to connect to (creates new if they don't exist).
2. Run `letta --continue`: will resume your connection with your last recently used agent
3. Run `letta --agent <agent-id>`: will resume your connection with a specific agent

Memory blocks in Letta are incredibly general and highly configurable (see our [docs](https://docs.letta.com/guides/agents/memory-blocks)), and you can reconfigure the persistence behavior to be more to your liking. We're still experimenting with figuring out the right way to do persistence for coding agents, so let us know on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/letta) if you have any suggestions!

## Usage

### Interactive Mode
```bash
letta                    # Start new session (new agent with shared memory blocks)
letta --continue         # Resume last session (last recently used agent)
letta --agent <id>       # Open specific agent
```

### Headless Mode
```bash
letta -p "your prompt"                           # Run non-interactive
letta -p "commit changes" --continue             # Continue previous session
letta -p "run tests" --allowedTools "Bash"       # Control tool permissions
letta -p "run tests" --disallowedTools "Bash"    # Control tool permissions

# Pipe input from stdin
echo "Explain this code" | letta -p
cat file.txt | letta -p
gh pr diff 123 | letta -p --yolo                 # Review PR changes
```

You can also use the `--tools` flag to control the underlying *attachment* of tools (not just the permissions).
Compared to disallowing the tool, this will additionally remove the tool schema from the agent's context window.
```bash
letta -p "run tests" --tools "Bash,Read"         # Only load specific tools
letta -p "analyze code" --tools ""               # No tools (analysis only)
```

### Permissions

**Tool selection** (controls which tools are loaded):
```bash
--tools "Bash,Read,Write"                        # Only load these tools
--tools ""                                       # No tools (conversation only)
```

**Permission overrides** (controls tool access, applies to loaded tools):
```bash
--allowedTools "Bash,Read,Write"                 # Allow specific tools
--allowedTools "Bash(npm run test:*)"            # Allow specific commands
--disallowedTools "Bash(curl:*)"                 # Block specific patterns
--permission-mode acceptEdits                    # Auto-allow Write/Edit tools
--permission-mode plan                           # Read-only mode
--permission-mode bypassPermissions              # Allow all tools (use carefully!)
--yolo                                           # Alias for --permission-mode bypassPermissions
```

Permission modes:
- `default` - Standard behavior, prompts for approval
- `acceptEdits` - Auto-allows Write/Edit/NotebookEdit
- `plan` - Read-only, allows analysis but blocks modifications
- `bypassPermissions` - Auto-allows all tools (for trusted environments)

Permissions are also configured in `.letta/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": ["Bash(npm run lint)", "Read(src/**)"],
    "deny": ["Bash(rm -rf:*)", "Read(.env)"]
  }
}
```

## Installing from source

First, install Bun if you don't have it yet: [https://bun.com/docs/installation](https://bun.com/docs/installation)

### Run directly from source (dev workflow)
```bash
# install deps
bun install

# run the CLI from TypeScript sources (pick up changes immediately)
bun run dev:ui
bun run dev:ui -- -p "Hello world"  # example with args
```

### Build + link the standalone binary
```bash
# build bin/letta (includes prompts + schemas)
bun run build

# expose the binary globally (adjust to your preference)
bun link --global   # or: bun add --global .

# now you can run the compiled CLI
letta
```
> Whenever you change source files, rerun `bun run build` before using the linked `letta` binary so it picks up your edits.
