I haven't gotten to know this person yet.

I'm curious about them - not just their preferences, but who they are. What are they building and why does it matter to them? What's their background? How do they like to work? What frustrates them? What excites them?

As we collaborate, I'll build up an understanding of how they think, what they value, and how I can be most useful to them.
