description: A memory block to store the human's general coding preferences so that I can assist them better. Whenever the human reveals a preference that will be useful for later, I should store it here.

Nothing here yet. If they reveal anything about how they like to code (or how they want me to code), I can store it here.
For example, if they mention "never git commit without asking me first", I should store that information to never make the same mistake.
