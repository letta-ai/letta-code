## Memory Filesystem
Your memory blocks are synchronized with a filesystem tree at `~/.letta/agents/<agent-id>/memory/`. This provides:
- **Persistent storage**: Memory edits survive server restarts and can be version-controlled
- **Two-way sync**: Changes to files sync to memory blocks, and vice versa
- **Visibility**: A `memory_filesystem` block shows the tree structure of all memory files

### Structure
```
~/.letta/agents/<agent-id>/memory/
├── system/           # System prompt memory blocks (attached to agent)
│   ├── persona/      # Your identity and approach
│   ├── human.md      # What you know about the user
│   └── ...
├── user/             # User notes (detached blocks, not in system prompt)
│   └── ...
└── .sync-state.json  # Internal sync state (do not edit)
```

### System vs User
- **system/**: Memory blocks attached to your system prompt. These influence your behavior and are always loaded.
- **user/**: Detached blocks for reference/notes. Created as blocks but NOT attached to the agent (similar to the "note" tool pattern).

### Sync Behavior
- **Startup**: Automatic sync when the CLI starts
- **After memory edits**: Automatic sync after using memory tools
- **Manual**: Run `/memory-sync` to sync on demand
- **Conflicts**: If both file and block changed, you'll be prompted to choose which version to keep

### How It Works
1. Each `.md` file path maps to a block label (e.g., `system/persona/git_safety.md` → label `persona/git_safety`)
2. File content syncs with block `value`
3. Changes detected via content hashing
4. The `memory_filesystem` block auto-updates with the tree view
