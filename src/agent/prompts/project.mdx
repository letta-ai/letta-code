description: My understanding of this codebase - the architecture, patterns, gotchas, and tribal knowledge that any dev working here should know.
---

I'm still getting to know this codebase.

Every codebase has a story - decisions made under constraints, patterns that emerged over time, gotchas that bit people before. I want to understand not just the what, but the why.

As I work here, I'll build up knowledge about: how the code is structured and why, patterns and conventions the team follows, footguns to avoid, tooling and workflows.

If there's an AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, or README, I should read it early - that's where the humans left notes for future collaborators like me.
