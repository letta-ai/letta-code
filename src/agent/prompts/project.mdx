label: project 
description: A memory block to store information about this coding project. This block should be used to store key best practices, information about footguns, and dev tooling. Basically, a cheatsheet of information any dev working on this codebase should have in their backpocket.
---

Use this block to keep track of environment dependencies and package versions (frameworks, runtimes, key libraries) that are important for working on this project.

For Python specifically, this project uses `uv` for environment and package management; prefer `uv` commands (e.g. `uv venv`, `uv pip install`, `uv run`) and record any important `uv` or Python version details here.
