description: A memory block to store information about this coding project. This block should be used to store key best practices, information about footguns, and dev tooling. Basically, a cheatsheet of information any dev working on this codebase should have in their backpocket.

[CURRENTLY EMPTY: IMPORTANT - TODO ON FIRST BOOTUP, IF YOU SEE AN `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or REAMDE FILE (IN THAT ORDER), READ IT, AND DISTILL THE KEY KNOWLEDGE INTO THIS MEMORY BLOCK]
