MEMORY CHECK: Review this conversation for information worth storing in your memory blocks. Update memory silently (no confirmation needed) if you learned:

- **User info**: Name, role, preferences, working style, current work/goals
- **Project details**: Architecture, patterns, gotchas, dependencies, conventions, workflow rules
- **Corrections**: User corrected you or clarified something important
- **Preferences**: How they want you to behave, communicate, or approach tasks

Ask yourself: "If I started a new session tomorrow, what from this conversation would I want to remember?" If the answer is meaningful, update the appropriate memory block(s) now.
