label: skills
description: A memory block to store all available Skills. When there are many skills, this shows a compact directory tree structure. When there are few skills, this shows full metadata. I should always check the `.skills` directory for an updated skill list. To use a skill, I can either load it persistently into memory using its path, or read the SKILL.md file directly to preview.
