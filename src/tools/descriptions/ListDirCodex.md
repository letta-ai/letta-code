# list_dir

Lists entries in a local directory, compatible with the Codex `list_dir` tool.

- **dir_path**: Absolute path to the directory to list.
- **offset / limit / depth**: Accepted for compatibility but currently ignored; the underlying implementation returns a tree-style listing of the directory.
