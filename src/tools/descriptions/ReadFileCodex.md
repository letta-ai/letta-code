# read_file

Reads a local file with 1-indexed line numbers, compatible with the Codex `read_file` tool.

- **file_path**: Absolute path to the file to read.
- **offset**: Optional starting line number (1-based) for the slice.
- **limit**: Optional maximum number of lines to return.
- **mode / indentation**: Accepted for compatibility with Codex but currently treated as slice-only; indentation mode is not yet implemented.
